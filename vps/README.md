# VPS

This VPS is a DigitalOcean Droplet with 1 vCPU and 512 MB of RAM. It's mainly used as a gateway for my home server.

## Important notes

There's also WireGuard installed at the system level. This installation is connected to the containerized version.

It's a weird setup but has its reasoning, I might make a post about this specific setup. But it's basically an evolution
of my previous setup: https://logs.gerardgascon.com/logs/exposed-my-home-server

This installation may also be dockerized in the future.
